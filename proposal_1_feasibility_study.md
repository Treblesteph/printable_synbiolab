# Project 1: printable synbiolab feasibility study

## Title

Printable SynBioLab - a feasability study

## The idea

> briefly summarise your proposal

We aim ultimately to enable the creation of new, sustainable synthetic biology labs in resource-poor environments with very little funding.

We will achieve this by curating open source designs and documentation for a full, minimal suite of synthetic biology lab equipment, and providing complete guidance from what manufacturing equipment to purchase through to how to construct and maintain the lab.

Here we propose taking the first steps towards making this a reality. We will first survey existing open source lab hardware projects. Each project will be evaluated based on the quality, completeness and cost-effectiveness of the engineering, electronics, software and documentation. For any equipment not covered adequately by existing projects, we will produce specifications and, if possible within the constrains of the project, initial designs. Based on these two analyses we will explore the feasibility of producing a synbio lab using entirely open source parts.

## Implementation

> Describe what you are planning to do with the funding, including aims, methods, outcomes and who will be involved

We aim to thoroughly survey open source lab hardware projects, evaluate their quality, and establish what needs to be done to achieve a practically useful complete set of open source synbiolab hardware.

This will be achieved in three phases:

Discovery phase:

1. Will we specify the minimal set of equipment, and the minimal capabilities of each piece of equipment, required to conduct basic synthetic biology research. We will achieve this by drawing on, and indexing, existing synthetic biology lab documentation and literature, and our own expertise. [SSU, BW]
2. Will will index existing hardware projects using a systematic, comprehensive internet and literature search. We will then create a simple, searchable online directory of these projects. The directory will be CC-0 licensed, hosted on the free Github Pages architecture and archived to Zenodo [SSU, BW]

Evaluation phase:

1. An inital evaluation of each project will assess its maturity and completeness. We will assess whether each project has resulted in a completed build, whether the build process is documented, and whether groups other than the original designers have reproduced the result. [SSU]
2. We will then filter the projects to consider only the several most mature and complete examples of each piece of equipment based on step 1. For these projects, we will perform an in-depth analysis of the hardware, electronics and software. Our assessments will include the technical suitability of the hardware and software designs, the cost-effectiveness of production, and the completeness and quality of documentation. If projects are appropriately well developed, we will carry out thoroughly documented test builds. [SSU, RSU, BW will conduct documentation and software evaluations, LPA and NP will conduct hardware evaluations and all members will collaborate on test builds]
3. The results from steps 1 and 2 will be added to the directory of open source lab hardware. [SSU]

Design and reporting phase:

1. If any required equipment has no candidate projects in the directory, we will produce technical specifications for the missing equipment and initiate open communities around each project. If time and resource constraints allow, we will also begin the design process, actively recruiting appropriate hardware experts if necessary. [all members]
2. We will then synthesise the results of all previous steps to produce a report on the feasibility of a complete open hardware synbio lab. The report will include summary of the open lab hardware index results, summaries of any new designs we initiated, and a detailed roadmap of what yet needs to be achieved.

Funding allocation:

The primary cost is the time of appropriately knowledgeable researchers. We therefore propose that the majority of the funding will be spent compensating participants for their time spent on the project, by dividing the funding between the participants proportionally to their contribution to the final outcomes. If any projects reach the test build phase, we may recover the costs of some materials from the grant.

Outcomes:

- A website with a searchable directory of open lab hardware projects, including assessments of each project.
- A feasibility report for the complete open synbio lab that organises the information in the directory - published on the project website and, time allowing, as a peer-reviewed paper.
- A detailed roadmap laying out the work required to realise the open synbio lab.

## Benefits and outcomes

> Describe how your project fits the remit of OpenPlant and the judging criteria, including details of any new interdisciplinary interactions between Cambridge and Norwich

The project has three clear, tangible outcomes, each of which would be a significant contribution to the synbio community.

High-quality documentation, and high standards in hardware and software, are fundamentally important in buiding foundational tools in a developing field. Our directory will help guide users to appropriate hardware projects, help potential contributors find projects to take part in, and help avoid duplication of effort by hardware developers. By evaluating the landscape of open lab hardware and identifying weaknesses, the project will help ensure a strong foundation for open hardware in synbio. Our final report and roadmap will lay the groundwork for a future project (to be submitted in a future round of the OpenPlant fund) in which the final designs, documentation, and a proof-of-concept full working open symbio lab are produced.

We have two 3D printing studios available for use at or below cost to this project - a Lulzbot Mini extrusion printer at FathomLabs (SSU & RSU), and a Stratasys Objet 30 Prime resin printer at TGAC (BW, LPA & NP). Both printers have an ongoing consumables budget, which should absorb most of the printing costs, if any. All members will commit the time necessary to complete the project outside their normal work hours. All participants have a strong track record of delivering high-quality technical projects using this mode of working.

Mozilla Science Lab (http://mozillascience.org) will provide partial matched funding via a fellowship to RSU. The fellowship includes a discretionary hardware budget of $3k that can be drawn upon for this project, and a travel budget to cover visits between institutions.

The collaboration between Cambridge and Norwich in this project is an expansion of a highly successful collaboration between RSU and BW on the BioJulia project (https://github.com/biojulia/bio.jl), which they jointly founded. By incorporating new collaborators with complementary expertise in technical documentation and mathematics (SSU) and practical hardware production and maintenance (LPA & NP), the team is uniquely positioned to execute this project sucessfuly and to a high standard.
