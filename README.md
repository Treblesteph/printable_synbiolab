*Reviewing the existing tools for 3d printing lab equipment and using this knowledge to create a well-documented synthetic biology lab.*

Hello and welcome to our project. We are just starting out and will be fleshing out the documentation very soon. In the meantime, please get in touch if you'd like to join us!

## Reviewing the existing tools

To begin with we will try to answer as many of the following questions as we can.

- What are the existing tools?
- what are their strengths and weaknesses?
- why are the existing tools not used more?
 
We will describe all of the existing technologies and evaluate them based on their technical quality (both the physical product, and software) and how well documented they are. Ultimately we aim to produce a feasibility study for creating the printable lab: what are the best versions of printable labs tools that exist, and how could they be improved, and which tools are totally missing.

## Creating an accessible, easy to use, good quality printable synthetic biology lab

By following these objectives we want to produce a complete printable lab with a working demo.

- document what we learn, as we learn
- re-use the elements of existing tools that work well
- be completely open, always
- have a nice site, great up-to-date documentation, and tutorials
- deploy the lab to research groups who are in need of equipment
  - print the parts
  - hold workshops and/or tutorials to make the equipment together
